Student project made in Isart Digital during my 3rd years.

The first part of the project was to create the AI. You can check the AI code [here](https://github.com/Lawlets/ChessAI/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/AI/ChessAI.cs).

In order to improve the speed of the game, I made a BitBoard. You can check the code [here](https://github.com/Lawlets/ChessAI/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/ChessBoard/Opti/BitBoard.cs)

The rest of the project was give has started. I change some code in order to match my code with the given one.
